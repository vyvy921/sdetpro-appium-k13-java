- There is a large family
- Each member in family has a different behavior

--------- "Strategy" Design Pattern
Steps:
    1. To list all behaviors in Interfaces
    2. Create classes to implement each Interface
    3. Create a parent class includes behaviors. Behaviors are interfaces that are created
    4. Create concrete class with a constructor to initialize the behavior(which is a Interface)
